# A script to run multiple GPU tests in parallel controlled with an environment
# variable. This script will assume that when it runs, one of the locks are
# already released. So the program calling this script is expected to make sure
# that only $TF_GPU_COUNT processes are running at any gien time.
#
# Required environment variables:
#     TF_GPU_COUNT = Number of GPUs available. This HAS TO BE IN SYNC with the
#                    value of --local_test_jobs flag for bazel.
