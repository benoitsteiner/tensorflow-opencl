/// A `Scope` object represents a set of related TensorFlow ops that have the
/// same properties such as a common name prefix.
///
/// A Scope object is a container for TensorFlow Op properties. Op constructors
/// get a Scope object as a mandatory first argument and the constructed op
/// acquires the properties in the object.
///
/// A simple example:
///
///     using namespace ops;
///     Scope root = Scope::NewRootScope();
///     auto c1 = Const(root, { {1, 1} });
///     auto m = MatMul(root, c1, { {41}, {1} });
///     GraphDef gdef;
///     Status s = root.ToGraphDef(&gdef);
///     if (!s.ok()) { ... }
///
/// Scope hierarchy:
///
/// The Scope class provides various With<> functions that create a new scope.
/// The new scope typically has one property changed while other properties are
/// inherited from the parent scope.
/// NewSubScope(name) method appends `name` to the prefix of names for ops
/// created within the scope, and WithOpName() changes the suffix which
/// otherwise defaults to the type of the op.
///
/// Name examples:
///
///     Scope root = Scope::NewRootScope();
///     Scope linear = root.NewSubScope("linear");
///     // W will be named "linear/W"
///     auto W = Variable(linear.WithOpName("W"),
///                       {2, 2}, DT_FLOAT);
///     // b will be named "linear/b"
///     auto b = Variable(linear.WithOpName("b"),
///                       {2}, DT_FLOAT);
///     auto x = Const(linear, {...});  // name: "linear/Const"
///     auto m = MatMul(linear, x, W);  // name: "linear/MatMul"
///     auto r = BiasAdd(linear, m, b); // name: "linear/BiasAdd"
///
/// Scope lifetime:
///
/// A new scope is created by calling Scope::NewRootScope. This creates some
/// resources that are shared by all the child scopes that inherit from this
/// scope, directly or transitively. For instance, a new scope creates a new
/// Graph object to which operations are added when the new scope or its
/// children are used by an Op constructor. The new scope also has a Status
/// object which will be used to indicate errors by Op-constructor functions
/// called on any child scope. The Op-constructor functions have to check the
/// scope's status by calling the ok() method before proceeding to construct the
/// op.
///
/// Thread safety:
///
/// A `Scope` object is NOT thread-safe. Threads cannot concurrently call
/// op-constructor functions on the same `Scope` object.
