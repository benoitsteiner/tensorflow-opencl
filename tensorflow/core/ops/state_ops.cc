Returns a tensor that may be mutated, but only persists within a single step.

This is an experimental op for internal use only and it is possible to use this
op in unsafe ways.  DO NOT USE unless you fully understand the risks.

It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that 'ref' is eventually passed to a
matching 'DestroyTemporaryVariable' op after all other uses have completed.

Outputs a ref to the tensor state so it may be read or modified.

  E.g.
      var = state_ops._temporary_variable([1, 2], types.float_)
      var_name = var.op.name
      var = state_ops.assign(var, [[4.0, 5.0]])

      final = state_ops._destroy_temporary_variable(var, var_name=var_name)

ref: A reference to the variable tensor.
shape: The shape of the variable tensor.
dtype: The type of elements in the variable tensor.
var_name: Overrides the name used for the temporary variable resource. Default
value is the name of the 'TemporaryVariable' op (which is guaranteed unique).

Destroys the temporary variable and returns its final value.

Sets output to the value of the Tensor pointed to by 'ref', then destroys
the temporary variable called 'var_name'.
All other uses of 'ref' *must* have executed before this op.
This is typically achieved by chaining the ref through each assign op, or by
using control dependencies.

Outputs the final value of the tensor pointed to by 'ref'.

ref: A reference to the temporary variable tensor.

'TemporaryVariable' op.
