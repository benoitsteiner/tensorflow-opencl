"""Ops for building neural network layers, regularizers, summaries, etc.

## Higher level ops for building neural network layers.

This package provides several ops that take care of creating variables that are
used internally in a consistent way and provide the building blocks for many
common machine learning algorithms.

Aliases for fully_connected which set a default activation function are
available: `relu`, `relu6` and `linear`.

## Regularizers

Regularization can help prevent overfitting. These have the signature
`fn(weights)`. The loss is typically added to
`tf.GraphKeys.REGULARIZATION_LOSSES`.

## Initializers

Initializers are used to initialize variables with sensible values given their
size, data type, and purpose.

## Summaries

The layers module defines convenience functions `summarize_variables`,
`summarize_weights` and `summarize_biases`, which set the `collection` argument
of `summarize_collection` to `VARIABLES`, `WEIGHTS` and `BIASES`, respectively.
