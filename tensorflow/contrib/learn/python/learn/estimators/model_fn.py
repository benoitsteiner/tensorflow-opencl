    """Creates a validated `ModelFnOps` instance.

    For a multi-headed model, the predictions dict here will contain the outputs
    of all of the heads.  However: at serving time, requests will be made
    specifically for one or more heads, and the RPCs used for these requests may
    differ by problem type (i.e., regression, classification, other).  The
    purpose of the output_alternatives dict is to aid in exporting a SavedModel
    from which such head-specific queries can be served.  These
    output_alternatives will be combined with input_alternatives (see
    `saved_model_export_utils`) to produce a set of `SignatureDef`s specifying
    the valid requests that can be served from this model.

    For a single-headed model, it is still adviseable to provide
    output_alternatives with a single entry, because this is how the problem
    type is communicated for export and serving.  If output_alternatives is not
    given, the resulting SavedModel will support only one head of unspecified
    type.

    Args:
      mode: One of `ModeKeys`. Specifies if this training, evaluation or
        prediction.
      predictions: Predictions `Tensor` or dict of `Tensor`.
      loss: Training loss `Tensor`.
      train_op: Op for the training step.
      eval_metric_ops: Dict of metric results keyed by name. The values of the
        dict are the results of calling a metric function, such as `Tensor`.
      signature_fn: The signature_fn used for exporting.
      output_alternatives: a dict of
        `{submodel_name: (problem_type, {tensor_name: Tensor})}`, where
        `submodel_name` is a submodel identifier that should be consistent
        across the pipeline (here likely taken from the name of each `Head`,
        for models that use them), `problem_type` is a `ProblemType`,
        `tensor_name` is a symbolic name for an output Tensor possibly but not
        necessarily taken from `PredictionKey`, and `Tensor` is the
        corresponding output Tensor itself.

    Returns:
      A validated `ModelFnOps` object.
