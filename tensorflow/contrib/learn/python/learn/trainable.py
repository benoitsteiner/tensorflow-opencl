    """Trains a model given training data `x` predictions and `y` labels.

    Args:
      x: Matrix of shape [n_samples, n_features...]. Can be iterator that
         returns arrays of features. The training input samples for fitting the
         model. If set, `input_fn` must be `None`.
      y: Vector or matrix [n_samples] or [n_samples, n_outputs]. Can be
         iterator that returns array of labels. The training label values
         (class labels in classification, real numbers in regression). If set,
         `input_fn` must be `None`.
      input_fn: Input function returning a tuple of:
          features - Dictionary of string feature name to `Tensor` or `Tensor`.
          labels - `Tensor` or dictionary of `Tensor` with labels.
        If input_fn is set, `x`, `y`, and `batch_size` must be `None`.
      steps: Number of steps for which to train model. If `None`, train forever.
        'steps' works incrementally. If you call two times fit(steps=10) then
        training occurs in total 20 steps. If you don't want to have incremental
        behaviour please set `max_steps` instead. If set, `max_steps` must be
        `None`.
      batch_size: minibatch size to use on the input, defaults to first
        dimension of `x`. Must be `None` if `input_fn` is provided.
      monitors: List of `BaseMonitor` subclass instances. Used for callbacks
        inside the training loop.
      max_steps: Number of total steps for which to train model. If `None`,
        train forever. If set, `steps` must be `None`.

        Two calls to `fit(steps=100)` means 200 training
        iterations. On the other hand, two calls to `fit(max_steps=100)` means
        that the second call will not do any iteration since first call did
        all 100 steps.

    Returns:
      `self`, for chaining.
