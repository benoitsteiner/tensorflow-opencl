class ImperativeMode(object):
  """Imperative mode execution of TensorFlow graphs.

  This class is a container for an ImperativeGraph, a session, and other
  context managers that enable imperative mode execution. The following is
  the common usage pattern:

  ```python
  server = tf.train.Server.create_local_server()
  with ImperativeMode(server.target):
    a = tf.random_normal([])
    b = tf.random_normal([])
    c = a + b
    c_val = c.value
    d = c + 1.0
    d_val = d.value
    # Expect d_val == c_val + 1.0
  ```

  ImperativeMode provides the illusion of immediate execution. It still
  constructs a graph and defers op execution. But when an op executes for
  the first time, its results are cached and the cached value is returned for
  future executions. The __exit__ method clears this graph and cached values.
  To use ImperativeMode inside a loop, the `new_step` method can be used to
  create a temporary context around the loop body to clear the cache at loop
  exit as follows:

  ```python
  server = tf.train.Server.create_local_server()
  with ImperativeMode(server.target) as mode:
    w = tf.get_variable('w', [])
    for i in range(10):
      with mode.new_step():
        x = tf.random_uniform([])
        y = tf.random_uniform([])
        z = w.assign_add(x + y)
        print(z.value)
  ```

  ImperativeMode graph does not support all TensorFlow operations and features.
  Here are the current known limitations of ImperativeMode :
  * Stateful operations returned ref-typed tensors are limited to
  TensorFlow Variables and the associated operations. Data structures such as
  queues barriers, etc. are not supported in ImperativeMode.
  * Variables created and managed via `tf.variable_scope` and the associated
  `tf.get_variable` are not supported. (These use auxiliary data structures in
  addition to the graph, which are not aware of the imperative mode execution.)

  TODO(keveman): Remove the above restrictions on ImperativeMode.
