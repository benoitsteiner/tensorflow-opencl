### `tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(_sentinel=None, labels=None, logits=None, dim=-1, name=None)` {#softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits}

Computes softmax cross entropy between `logits` and `labels`.

Measures the probability error in discrete classification tasks in which the
classes are mutually exclusive (each entry is in exactly one class).  For
example, each CIFAR-10 image is labeled with one and only one label: an image
can be a dog or a truck, but not both.

**NOTE:**  While the classes are mutually exclusive, their probabilities
need not be.  All that is required is that each row of `labels` is
a valid probability distribution.  If they are not, the computation of the
gradient will be incorrect.

If using exclusive `labels` (wherein one and only
one class is true at a time), see `sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits`.

**WARNING:** This op expects unscaled logits, since it performs a `softmax`
on `logits` internally for efficiency.  Do not call this op with the
output of `softmax`, as it will produce incorrect results.

`logits` and `labels` must have the same shape `[batch_size, num_classes]`
and the same dtype (either `float16`, `float32`, or `float64`).

**Note that to avoid confusion, it is required to pass only named arguments to
this function.**

##### Args:

  _sentinel: Used to prevent positional parameters. Internal, do not use.

*  <b>`labels`</b>: Each row `labels[i]` must be a valid probability distribution.
*  <b>`logits`</b>: Unscaled log probabilities.
*  <b>`dim`</b>: The class dimension. Defaulted to -1 which is the last dimension.
*  <b>`name`</b>: A name for the operation (optional).

##### Returns:

  A 1-D `Tensor` of length `batch_size` of the same type as `logits` with the
  softmax cross entropy loss.
