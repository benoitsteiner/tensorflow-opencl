### `tf.train.summary_iterator(path)` {#summary_iterator}

An iterator for reading `Event` protocol buffers from an event file.

You can use this function to read events written to an event file. It returns
a Python iterator that yields `Event` protocol buffers.

Example: Print the contents of an events file.

```python
for e in tf.train.summary_iterator(path to events file):
    print(e)
```

Example: Print selected summary values.

```python
# This example supposes that the events file contains summaries with a
# summary value tag 'loss'.  These could have been added by calling
# `add_summary()`, passing the output of a scalar summary op created with
# with: `tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss_tensor)`.
for e in tf.train.summary_iterator(path to events file):
    for v in e.summary.value:
        if v.tag == 'loss':
            print(v.simple_value)
```

##### Args:


*  <b>`path`</b>: The path to an event file created by a `SummaryWriter`.

##### Yields:
