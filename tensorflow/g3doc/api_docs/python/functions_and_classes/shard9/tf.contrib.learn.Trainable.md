#### `tf.contrib.learn.Trainable.fit(x=None, y=None, input_fn=None, steps=None, batch_size=None, monitors=None, max_steps=None)` {#Trainable.fit}

Trains a model given training data `x` predictions and `y` labels.

##### Args:


*  <b>`x`</b>: Matrix of shape [n_samples, n_features...]. Can be iterator that
     returns arrays of features. The training input samples for fitting the
     model. If set, `input_fn` must be `None`.
*  <b>`y`</b>: Vector or matrix [n_samples] or [n_samples, n_outputs]. Can be
     iterator that returns array of labels. The training label values
     (class labels in classification, real numbers in regression). If set,
     `input_fn` must be `None`. Note: For classification, label values must
     be integers representing the class index (i.e. values from 0 to
     n_classes-1).
*  <b>`input_fn`</b>: Input function returning a tuple of:
      features - Dictionary of string feature name to `Tensor` or `Tensor`.
      labels - `Tensor` or dictionary of `Tensor` with labels.
    If input_fn is set, `x`, `y`, and `batch_size` must be `None`.
*  <b>`steps`</b>: Number of steps for which to train model. If `None`, train forever.
    'steps' works incrementally. If you call two times fit(steps=10) then
    training occurs in total 20 steps. If you don't want to have incremental
    behaviour please set `max_steps` instead. If set, `max_steps` must be
    `None`.
*  <b>`batch_size`</b>: minibatch size to use on the input, defaults to first
    dimension of `x`. Must be `None` if `input_fn` is provided.
*  <b>`monitors`</b>: List of `BaseMonitor` subclass instances. Used for callbacks
    inside the training loop.
*  <b>`max_steps`</b>: Number of total steps for which to train model. If `None`,
    train forever. If set, `steps` must be `None`.

    Two calls to `fit(steps=100)` means 200 training
    iterations. On the other hand, two calls to `fit(max_steps=100)` means
    that the second call will not do any iteration since first call did
    all 100 steps.

##### Returns:

  `self`, for chaining.
