### `tf.nn.raw_rnn(cell, loop_fn, parallel_iterations=None, swap_memory=False, scope=None)` {#raw_rnn}

Creates an `RNN` specified by RNNCell `cell` and loop function `loop_fn`.

**NOTE: This method is still in testing, and the API may change.**

This function is a more primitive version of `dynamic_rnn` that provides
more direct access to the inputs each iteration.  It also provides more
control over when to start and finish reading the sequence, and
what to emit for the output.

For example, it can be used to implement the dynamic decoder of a seq2seq
model.

Instead of working with `Tensor` objects, most operations work with
`TensorArray` objects directly.

The operation of `raw_rnn`, in pseudo-code, is basically the following:

```python
time = tf.constant(0, dtype=tf.int32)
(finished, next_input, initial_state, _, loop_state) = loop_fn(
    time=time, cell_output=None, cell_state=None, loop_state=None)
emit_ta = TensorArray(dynamic_size=True, dtype=initial_state.dtype)
state = initial_state
while not all(finished):
  (output, cell_state) = cell(next_input, state)
  (next_finished, next_input, next_state, emit, loop_state) = loop_fn(
      time=time + 1, cell_output=output, cell_state=cell_state,
      loop_state=loop_state)
  # Emit zeros and copy forward state for minibatch entries that are finished.
  state = tf.where(finished, state, next_state)
  emit = tf.where(finished, tf.zeros_like(emit), emit)
  emit_ta = emit_ta.write(time, emit)
  # If any new minibatch entries are marked as finished, mark these.
  finished = tf.logical_or(finished, next_finished)
  time += 1
return (emit_ta, state, loop_state)
```

with the additional properties that output and state may be (possibly nested)
tuples, as determined by `cell.output_size` and `cell.state_size`, and
as a result the final `state` and `emit_ta` may themselves be tuples.

A simple implementation of `dynamic_rnn` via `raw_rnn` looks like this:

```python
inputs = tf.placeholder(shape=(max_time, batch_size, input_depth),
                        dtype=tf.float32)
sequence_length = tf.placeholder(shape=(batch_size,), dtype=tf.int32)
inputs_ta = tf.TensorArray(dtype=tf.float32, size=max_time)
inputs_ta = inputs_ta.unpack(inputs)

cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMCell(num_units)

def loop_fn(time, cell_output, cell_state, loop_state):
  emit_output = cell_output  # == None for time == 0
  if cell_output is None:  # time == 0
    next_cell_state = cell.zero_state(batch_size, tf.float32)
  else:
    next_cell_state = cell_state
  elements_finished = (time >= sequence_length)
  finished = tf.reduce_all(elements_finished)
  next_input = tf.cond(
      finished,
      lambda: tf.zeros([batch_size, input_depth], dtype=tf.float32),
      lambda: inputs_ta.read(time))
  next_loop_state = None
  return (elements_finished, next_input, next_cell_state,
          emit_output, next_loop_state)

outputs_ta, final_state, _ = raw_rnn(cell, loop_fn)
outputs = outputs_ta.pack()
```

##### Args:


*  <b>`cell`</b>: An instance of RNNCell.
*  <b>`loop_fn`</b>: A callable that takes inputs
    `(time, cell_output, cell_state, loop_state)`
    and returns the tuple
    `(finished, next_input, next_cell_state, emit_output, next_loop_state)`.
    Here `time` is an int32 scalar `Tensor`, `cell_output` is a
    `Tensor` or (possibly nested) tuple of tensors as determined by
    `cell.output_size`, and `cell_state` is a `Tensor`
    or (possibly nested) tuple of tensors, as determined by the `loop_fn`
    on its first call (and should match `cell.state_size`).
    The outputs are: `finished`, a boolean `Tensor` of
    shape `[batch_size]`, `next_input`: the next input to feed to `cell`,
    `next_cell_state`: the next state to feed to `cell`,
    and `emit_output`: the output to store for this iteration.

    Note that `emit_output` should be a `Tensor` or (possibly nested)
    tuple of tensors with shapes and structure matching `cell.output_size`
    and `cell_output` above.  The parameter `cell_state` and output
    `next_cell_state` may be either a single or (possibly nested) tuple
    of tensors.  The parameter `loop_state` and
    output `next_loop_state` may be either a single or (possibly nested) tuple
    of `Tensor` and `TensorArray` objects.  This last parameter
    may be ignored by `loop_fn` and the return value may be `None`.  If it
    is not `None`, then the `loop_state` will be propagated through the RNN
    loop, for use purely by `loop_fn` to keep track of its own state.
    The `next_loop_state` parameter returned may be `None`.

    The first call to `loop_fn` will be `time = 0`, `cell_output = None`,
    `cell_state = None`, and `loop_state = None`.  For this call:
    The `next_cell_state` value should be the value with which to initialize
    the cell's state.  It may be a final state from a previous RNN or it
    may be the output of `cell.zero_state()`.  It should be a
    (possibly nested) tuple structure of tensors.
    If `cell.state_size` is an integer, this must be
    a `Tensor` of appropriate type and shape `[batch_size, cell.state_size]`.
    If `cell.state_size` is a `TensorShape`, this must be a `Tensor` of
    appropriate type and shape `[batch_size] + cell.state_size`.
    If `cell.state_size` is a (possibly nested) tuple of ints or
    `TensorShape`, this will be a tuple having the corresponding shapes.
    The `emit_output` value may be  either `None` or a (possibly nested)
    tuple structure of tensors, e.g.,
    `(tf.zeros(shape_0, dtype=dtype_0), tf.zeros(shape_1, dtype=dtype_1))`.
    If this first `emit_output` return value is `None`,
    then the `emit_ta` result of `raw_rnn` will have the same structure and
    dtypes as `cell.output_size`.  Otherwise `emit_ta` will have the same
    structure, shapes (prepended with a `batch_size` dimension), and dtypes
    as `emit_output`.  The actual values returned for `emit_output` at this
    initializing call are ignored.  Note, this emit structure must be
    consistent across all time steps.


*  <b>`parallel_iterations`</b>: (Default: 32).  The number of iterations to run in
    parallel.  Those operations which do not have any temporal dependency
    and can be run in parallel, will be.  This parameter trades off
    time for space.  Values >> 1 use more memory but take less time,
    while smaller values use less memory but computations take longer.
*  <b>`swap_memory`</b>: Transparently swap the tensors produced in forward inference
    but needed for back prop from GPU to CPU.  This allows training RNNs
    which would typically not fit on a single GPU, with very minimal (or no)
    performance penalty.
*  <b>`scope`</b>: VariableScope for the created subgraph; defaults to "rnn".

##### Returns:

  A tuple `(emit_ta, final_state, final_loop_state)` where:

  `emit_ta`: The RNN output `TensorArray`.
     If `loop_fn` returns a (possibly nested) set of Tensors for
     `emit_output` during initialization, (inputs `time = 0`,
     `cell_output = None`, and `loop_state = None`), then `emit_ta` will
     have the same structure, dtypes, and shapes as `emit_output` instead.
     If `loop_fn` returns `emit_output = None` during this call,
     the structure of `cell.output_size` is used:
     If `cell.output_size` is a (possibly nested) tuple of integers
     or `TensorShape` objects, then `emit_ta` will be a tuple having the
     same structure as `cell.output_size`, containing TensorArrays whose
     elements' shapes correspond to the shape data in `cell.output_size`.

  `final_state`: The final cell state.  If `cell.state_size` is an int, this
    will be shaped `[batch_size, cell.state_size]`.  If it is a
    `TensorShape`, this will be shaped `[batch_size] + cell.state_size`.
    If it is a (possibly nested) tuple of ints or `TensorShape`, this will
    be a tuple having the corresponding shapes.

  `final_loop_state`: The final loop state as returned by `loop_fn`.

##### Raises:


*  <b>`TypeError`</b>: If `cell` is not an instance of RNNCell, or `loop_fn` is not
    a `callable`.
