### `tf.get_local_variable(*args, **kwargs)` {#get_local_variable}

Gets an existing *local* variable or creates a new one.

Behavior is the same as in `get_variable`, except that variables are
added to the `LOCAL_VARIABLES` collection and `trainable` is set to
`False`.
This function prefixes the name with the current variable scope
and performs reuse checks. See the
[Variable Scope How To](../../how_tos/variable_scope/index.md)
for an extensive description of how reusing works. Here is a basic example:

```python
with tf.variable_scope("foo"):
    v = tf.get_variable("v", [1])  # v.name == "foo/v:0"
    w = tf.get_variable("w", [1])  # w.name == "foo/w:0"
with tf.variable_scope("foo", reuse=True):
    v1 = tf.get_variable("v")  # The same as v above.
```

If initializer is `None` (the default), the default initializer passed in
the variable scope will be used. If that one is `None` too, a
`glorot_uniform_initializer` will be used. The initializer can also be
a Tensor, in which case the variable is initialized to this value and shape.

Similarly, if the regularizer is `None` (the default), the default regularizer
passed in the variable scope will be used (if that is `None` too,
then by default no regularization is performed).

If a partitioner is provided, a `PartitionedVariable` is returned.
Accessing this object as a `Tensor` returns the shards concatenated along
the partition axis.

Some useful partitioners are available.  See, e.g.,
`variable_axis_size_partitioner` and `min_max_variable_partitioner`.

##### Args:


*  <b>`name`</b>: The name of the new or existing variable.
*  <b>`shape`</b>: Shape of the new or existing variable.
*  <b>`dtype`</b>: Type of the new or existing variable (defaults to `DT_FLOAT`).
*  <b>`initializer`</b>: Initializer for the variable if one is created.
*  <b>`regularizer`</b>: A (Tensor -> Tensor or None) function; the result of
    applying it on a newly created variable will be added to the collection
    @{tf.GraphKeys.REGULARIZATION_LOSSES} and can be used for regularization.
*  <b>`collections`</b>: List of graph collections keys to add the Variable to.
    Defaults to `[GraphKeys.LOCAL_VARIABLES]` (see `tf.Variable`).
*  <b>`caching_device`</b>: Optional device string or function describing where the
    Variable should be cached for reading.  Defaults to the Variable's
    device.  If not `None`, caches on another device.  Typical use is to
    cache on the device where the Ops using the Variable reside, to
    deduplicate copying through `Switch` and other conditional statements.
*  <b>`partitioner`</b>: Optional callable that accepts a fully defined `TensorShape`
    and `dtype` of the Variable to be created, and returns a list of
    partitions for each axis (currently only one axis can be partitioned).
*  <b>`validate_shape`</b>: If False, allows the variable to be initialized with a
      value of unknown shape. If True, the default, the shape of initial_value
      must be known.
*  <b>`use_resource`</b>: If False, creates a regular Variable. If true, creates an
    experimental ResourceVariable instead with well-defined semantics.
    Defaults to False (will later change to True).
*  <b>`custom_getter`</b>: Callable that takes as a first argument the true getter, and
    allows overwriting the internal get_variable method.
    The signature of `custom_getter` should match that of this method,
    but the most future-proof version will allow for changes:
    `def custom_getter(getter, *args, **kwargs)`.  Direct access to
    all `get_variable` parameters is also allowed:
    `def custom_getter(getter, name, *args, **kwargs)`.  A simple identity
    custom getter that simply creates variables with modified names is:
    ```python
    def custom_getter(getter, name, *args, **kwargs):
      return getter(name + '_suffix', *args, **kwargs)
    ```

##### Returns:

  The created or existing `Variable` (or `PartitionedVariable`, if a
  partitioner was used).

##### Raises:


*  <b>`ValueError`</b>: when creating a new variable and shape is not declared,
    when violating reuse during variable creation, or when `initializer` dtype
    and `dtype` don't match. Reuse is set inside `variable_scope`.
