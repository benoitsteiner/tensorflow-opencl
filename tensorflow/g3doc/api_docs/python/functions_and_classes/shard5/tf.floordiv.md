### `tf.floordiv(x, y, name=None)` {#floordiv}

Divides `x / y` elementwise, rounding toward the most negative integer.

The same as `tf.div(x,y)` for integers, but uses `tf.floor(tf.div(x,y))` for
floating point arguments so that the result is always an integer (though
possibly an integer represented as floating point).  This op is generated by
`x // y` floor division in Python 3 and in Python 2.7 with
`from __future__ import division`.

Note that for efficiency, `floordiv` uses C semantics for negative numbers
(unlike Python and Numpy).

`x` and `y` must have the same type, and the result will have the same type
as well.

##### Args:


*  <b>`x`</b>: `Tensor` numerator of real numeric type.
*  <b>`y`</b>: `Tensor` denominator of real numeric type.
*  <b>`name`</b>: A name for the operation (optional).

##### Returns:

  `x / y` rounded down (except possibly towards zero for negative integers).

##### Raises:


*  <b>`TypeError`</b>: If the inputs are complex.
