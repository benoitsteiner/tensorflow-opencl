### `tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected(*args, **kwargs)` {#fully_connected}

Adds a fully connected layer.

`fully_connected` creates a variable called `weights`, representing a fully
connected weight matrix, which is multiplied by the `inputs` to produce a
`Tensor` of hidden units. If a `normalizer_fn` is provided (such as
`batch_norm`), it is then applied. Otherwise, if `normalizer_fn` is
None and a `biases_initializer` is provided then a `biases` variable would be
created and added the hidden units. Finally, if `activation_fn` is not `None`,
it is applied to the hidden units as well.

Note: that if `inputs` have a rank greater than 2, then `inputs` is flattened
prior to the initial matrix multiply by `weights`.

##### Args:


*  <b>`inputs`</b>: A tensor of with at least rank 2 and value for the last dimension,
    i.e. `[batch_size, depth]`, `[None, None, None, channels]`.
*  <b>`num_outputs`</b>: Integer or long, the number of output units in the layer.
*  <b>`activation_fn`</b>: activation function, set to None to skip it and maintain
    a linear activation.
*  <b>`normalizer_fn`</b>: normalization function to use instead of `biases`. If
    `normalizer_fn` is provided then `biases_initializer` and
    `biases_regularizer` are ignored and `biases` are not created nor added.
    default set to None for no normalizer function
*  <b>`normalizer_params`</b>: normalization function parameters.
*  <b>`weights_initializer`</b>: An initializer for the weights.
*  <b>`weights_regularizer`</b>: Optional regularizer for the weights.
*  <b>`biases_initializer`</b>: An initializer for the biases. If None skip biases.
*  <b>`biases_regularizer`</b>: Optional regularizer for the biases.
*  <b>`reuse`</b>: whether or not the layer and its variables should be reused. To be
    able to reuse the layer scope must be given.
*  <b>`variables_collections`</b>: Optional list of collections for all the variables or
    a dictionary containing a different list of collections per variable.
*  <b>`outputs_collections`</b>: collection to add the outputs.
*  <b>`trainable`</b>: If `True` also add variables to the graph collection
    `GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES` (see tf.Variable).
*  <b>`scope`</b>: Optional scope for variable_scope.

##### Returns:

   The tensor variable representing the result of the series of operations.

##### Raises:


*  <b>`ValueError`</b>: if x has rank less than 2 or if its last dimension is not set.
