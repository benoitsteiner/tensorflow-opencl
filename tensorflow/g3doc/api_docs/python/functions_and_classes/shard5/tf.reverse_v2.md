### `tf.reverse_v2(tensor, axis, name=None)` {#reverse_v2}

Reverses specific dimensions of a tensor.

Given a `tensor`, and a `int32` tensor `axis` representing the set of
dimensions of `tensor` to reverse. This operation reverses each dimension
`i` for which there exists `j` s.t. `axis[j] == i`.

`tensor` can have up to 8 dimensions. The number of dimensions specified
in `axis` may be 0 or more entries. If an index is specified more than
once, a InvalidArgument error is raised.

For example:

```prettyprint
# tensor 't' is [[[[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
#                  [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
#                  [ 8,  9, 10, 11]],
#                 [[12, 13, 14, 15],
#                  [16, 17, 18, 19],
#                  [20, 21, 22, 23]]]]
# tensor 't' shape is [1, 2, 3, 4]

# 'dims' is [3] or 'dims' is -1
reverse(t, dims) ==> [[[[ 3,  2,  1,  0],
                        [ 7,  6,  5,  4],
                        [ 11, 10, 9, 8]],
                       [[15, 14, 13, 12],
                        [19, 18, 17, 16],
                        [23, 22, 21, 20]]]]

# 'dims' is '[1]' (or 'dims' is '[-3]')
reverse(t, dims) ==> [[[[12, 13, 14, 15],
                        [16, 17, 18, 19],
                        [20, 21, 22, 23]
                       [[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
                        [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
                        [ 8,  9, 10, 11]]]]

# 'dims' is '[2]' (or 'dims' is '[-2]')
reverse(t, dims) ==> [[[[8, 9, 10, 11],
                        [4, 5, 6, 7],
                        [0, 1, 2, 3]]
                       [[20, 21, 22, 23],
                        [16, 17, 18, 19],
                        [12, 13, 14, 15]]]]
```

##### Args:


*  <b>`tensor`</b>: A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `uint8`, `int8`, `int32`, `int64`, `bool`, `half`, `float32`, `float64`, `complex64`, `complex128`.
    Up to 8-D.
*  <b>`axis`</b>: A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`.
    1-D. The indices of the dimensions to reverse.
*  <b>`name`</b>: A name for the operation (optional).

##### Returns:

  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `tensor`. The same shape as `tensor`.
