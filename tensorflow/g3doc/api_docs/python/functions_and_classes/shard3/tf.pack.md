### `tf.pack(values, axis=0, name='pack')` {#pack}

DEPRECATED: Use stack.

Packs a list of rank-`R` tensors into one rank-`(R+1)` tensor.

Packs the list of tensors in `values` into a tensor with rank one higher than
each tensor in `values`, by packing them along the `axis` dimension.
Given a list of length `N` of tensors of shape `(A, B, C)`;

if `axis == 0` then the `output` tensor will have the shape `(N, A, B, C)`.
if `axis == 1` then the `output` tensor will have the shape `(A, N, B, C)`.
Etc.

For example:

```prettyprint
# 'x' is [1, 4]
# 'y' is [2, 5]
# 'z' is [3, 6]
pack([x, y, z]) => [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]  # Pack along first dim.
pack([x, y, z], axis=1) => [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
```

This is the opposite of unpack.  The numpy equivalent is

    tf.pack([x, y, z]) = np.asarray([x, y, z])

##### Args:


*  <b>`values`</b>: A list of `Tensor` objects with the same shape and type.
*  <b>`axis`</b>: An `int`. The axis to pack along. Defaults to the first dimension.
    Supports negative indexes.
*  <b>`name`</b>: A name for this operation (optional).

##### Returns:


*  <b>`output`</b>: A packed `Tensor` with the same type as `values`.

##### Raises:


*  <b>`ValueError`</b>: If `axis` is out of the range [-(R+1), R+1).
