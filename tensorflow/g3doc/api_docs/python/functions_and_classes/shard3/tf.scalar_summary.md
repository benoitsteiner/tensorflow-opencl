### `tf.scalar_summary(*args, **kwargs)` {#scalar_summary}

Outputs a `Summary` protocol buffer with scalar values. (deprecated)

THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed after 2016-11-30.
Instructions for updating:
Please switch to tf.summary.scalar. Note that tf.summary.histogram uses the node name instead of the tag. This means that TensorFlow will automatically de-duplicate summary names based on the scope they are created in. Also, passing a tensor or list of tags to a single scalar summary is no longer supported.

  The input `tags` and `values` must have the same shape.  The generated
  summary has a summary value for each tag-value pair in `tags` and `values`.

  Args:
    tags: A `string` `Tensor`.  Tags for the summaries.
    values: A real numeric Tensor.  Values for the summaries.
    collections: Optional list of graph collections keys. The new summary op is
      added to these collections. Defaults to `[GraphKeys.SUMMARIES]`.
    name: A name for the operation (optional).

  Returns:
    A scalar `Tensor` of type `string`. The serialized `Summary` protocol
    buffer.
