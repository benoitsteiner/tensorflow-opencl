### `tf.contrib.training.batch_sequences_with_states(input_key, input_sequences, input_context, input_length, initial_states, num_unroll, batch_size, num_threads=3, capacity=1000, allow_small_batch=True, pad=True, name=None)` {#batch_sequences_with_states}

Creates batches of segments of sequential input.

This method creates a `SequenceQueueingStateSaver` (SQSS) and adds it to
the queuerunners. It returns a `NextQueuedSequenceBatch`.

It accepts one example at a time identified by a unique `input_key`.
`input_sequence` is a dict with values that are tensors with time as first
dimension. This time dimension must be the same across those tensors of an
example. It can vary across examples. Although it always has to be a multiple
of `num_unroll`. Hence, padding may be necessary and it is turned on by
default by `pad=True`.

`input_length` is a Tensor scalar or an int recording the time dimension prior
to padding. It should be between 0 and the time dimension. One reason we want
to keep track of it is so that we can take it into consideration when
computing the loss. If `pad=True` then `input_length` can be `None` and will
be inferred.

This methods segments `input_sequence` into segments of length `num_unroll`.
It batches input sequences from `batch_size` many examples. These mini-batches
are available through the `sequence` property of the output. Moreover, for
each entry in the batch we can access its original `input_key` in `key` and
its input length in `total_length`. `length` records within this segment how
many non-padded time steps there are.

Static features of an example that do not vary across time can be part of the
`input_context`, a dict with Tensor values. This method copies the context for
each segment and makes it available in the `context` of the output.

This method can maintain and update a state for each example. It accepts some
initial_states as a dict with Tensor values. The first mini-batch an example
is contained has initial_states as entry of the `state`. If save_state is
called then the next segment will have the updated entry of the `state`.
See `NextQueuedSequenceBatch` for a complete list of properties and methods.

Example usage:

```python
batch_size = 32
num_unroll = 20
num_enqueue_threads = 3
lstm_size = 8
cell = tf.contrib.rnn.BasicLSTMCell(num_units=lstm_size)

key, sequences, context = my_parser(raw_data)
initial_state_values = tf.zeros((state_size,), dtype=tf.float32)
initial_states = {"lstm_state": initial_state_values}
batch = tf.batch_sequences_with_states(
    input_key=key,
    input_sequences=sequences,
    input_context=context,
    initial_states=initial_states,
    num_unroll=num_unroll,
    batch_size=batch_size,
    num_threads=num_enqueue_threads,
    capacity=batch_size * num_enqueue_threads * 2)

inputs = batch.sequences["input"]
context_label = batch.context["label"]

inputs_by_time = tf.split(1, num_unroll, inputs)
assert len(inputs_by_time) == num_unroll

lstm_output, _ = tf.nn.state_saving_rnn(
  cell,
  inputs_by_time,
  state_saver=batch,
  state_name="lstm_state")

# Start a prefetcher in the background
sess = tf.Session()

tf.train.start_queue_runners(sess=session)

while True:
  # Step through batches, perform training or inference...
  session.run([lstm_output])
```

##### Args:


*  <b>`input_key`</b>: A string scalar `Tensor`, the **unique** key for the given
    input example.  This is used to keep track of the split minibatch elements
    of this input.  Batched keys of the current iteration are made
    accessible via the `key` property.  The shape of `input_key` (scalar) must
    be fully specified.
*  <b>`input_sequences`</b>: A dict mapping string names to `Tensor` values.  The values
    must all have matching first dimension, called `value_length`. They may
    vary from input to input. The remainder of the shape (other than the first
    dimension) must be fully specified.
    The `SequenceQueueingStateSaver` will split these tensors along
    this first dimension into minibatch elements of dimension `num_unrolled`.
    Batched and segmented sequences of the current iteration are made
    accessible via the `sequences` property.

    **Note**: if `pad=False`, then `value_length` must always be a multiple
      of `num_unroll`.

*  <b>`input_context`</b>: A dict mapping string names to `Tensor` values.  The values
    are treated as "global" across all time splits of the given input example,
    and will be copied across for all minibatch elements accordingly.
    Batched and copied context of the current iteration are made
    accessible via the `context` property.

    **Note**: All input_context values must have fully defined shapes.

*  <b>`input_length`</b>: None or an int32 scalar `Tensor`, the length of the sequence
    prior to padding. If `input_length=None` and `pad=True` then the length
    will be inferred and will be equal to `value_length`. If `pad=False` then
    `input_length` cannot be `None`: `input_length` must be specified. Its
    shape of `input_length` (scalar) must be fully specified. Its value may be
    at most `value_length` for any given input (see above for the definition
    of `value_length`). Batched and total lengths of the current iteration are
    made accessible via the `length` and `total_length` properties.
*  <b>`initial_states`</b>: A dict mapping string state names to multi-dimensional
    values (e.g. constants or tensors).  This input defines the set of
    states that will be kept track of during computing iterations, and
    which can be accessed via the `state` and `save_state` methods.

    **Note**: All initial_state values must have fully defined shapes.

*  <b>`num_unroll`</b>: Python integer, how many time steps to unroll at a time.
    The input sequences of length k are then split into k / num_unroll many
    segments.
*  <b>`batch_size`</b>: int or int32 scalar `Tensor`, how large minibatches should
    be when accessing the `state()` method and `context`, `sequences`, etc,
    properties.
*  <b>`num_threads`</b>: The int number of threads enqueuing input examples into a
    queue.
*  <b>`capacity`</b>: The max capacity of the queue in number of examples. Needs to be
    at least `batch_size`. Defaults to 1000. When iterating over the same
    input example multiple times reusing their keys the `capacity` must be
    smaller than the number of examples.
*  <b>`allow_small_batch`</b>: If true, the queue will return smaller batches when
    there aren't enough input examples to fill a whole batch and the end of
    the input has been reached.
*  <b>`pad`</b>: If `True`, `input_sequences` will be padded to multiple of
    `num_unroll`. In that case `input_length` may be `None` and is assumed to
    be the length of first dimension of values in `input_sequences`
    (i.e. `value_length`).
*  <b>`name`</b>: An op name string (optional).

##### Returns:

  A NextQueuedSequenceBatch with segmented and batched inputs and their
  states.

##### Raises:


*  <b>`TypeError`</b>: if any of the inputs is not an expected type.
*  <b>`ValueError`</b>: if any of the input values is inconsistent, e.g. if
    not enough shape information is available from inputs to build
    the state saver.
