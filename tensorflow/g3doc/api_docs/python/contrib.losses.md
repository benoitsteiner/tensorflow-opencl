SOME ARGUMENTS ARE DEPRECATED. They will be removed after 2016-11-25.
Instructions for updating:

loss is simply scaled by the given value. If `weight` is a tensor of size
[batch_size], then the total loss for each sample of the batch is rescaled
by the corresponding element in the `weight` vector. If the shape of
`weight` matches the shape of `predictions`, then the loss of each
measurable element of `predictions` is scaled by the corresponding value of
`weight`.

### `tf.contrib.losses.mean_pairwise_squared_error(*args, **kwargs)` {#mean_pairwise_squared_error}

Adds a pairwise-errors-squared loss to the training procedure. (deprecated arguments) (deprecated)

THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed after 2016-12-30.
Instructions for updating:
Use tf.losses.mean_pairwise_squared_error instead.

SOME ARGUMENTS ARE DEPRECATED. They will be removed after 2016-11-25.
Instructions for updating:
`targets` is being deprecated, use `labels`. `weight` is being deprecated, use `weights`.

Unlike `mean_squared_error`, which is a measure of the differences between
corresponding elements of `predictions` and `labels`,
`mean_pairwise_squared_error` is a measure of the differences between pairs of
corresponding elements of `predictions` and `labels`.

For example, if `labels`=[a, b, c] and `predictions`=[x, y, z], there are
three pairs of differences are summed to compute the loss:
  loss = [ ((a-b) - (x-y)).^2 + ((a-c) - (x-z)).^2 + ((b-c) - (y-z)).^2 ] / 3

Note that since the inputs are of size [batch_size, d0, ... dN], the
corresponding pairs are computed within each batch sample but not across
samples within a batch. For example, if `predictions` represents a batch of
16 grayscale images of dimension [batch_size, 100, 200], then the set of pairs
is drawn from each image, but not across images.

`weight` acts as a coefficient for the loss. If a scalar is provided, then the
loss is simply scaled by the given value. If `weight` is a tensor of size
[batch_size], then the total loss for each sample of the batch is rescaled
by the corresponding element in the `weight` vector.

##### Args:


*  <b>`predictions`</b>: The predicted outputs, a tensor of size [batch_size, d0, .. dN]
    where N+1 is the total number of dimensions in `predictions`.
*  <b>`labels`</b>: The ground truth output tensor, whose shape must match the shape of
    the `predictions` tensor.
*  <b>`weights`</b>: Coefficients for the loss a scalar, a tensor of shape [batch_size]
    or a tensor whose shape matches `predictions`.
*  <b>`scope`</b>: The scope for the operations performed in computing the loss.
*  <b>`targets`</b>: Deprecated alias for `labels`.
*  <b>`weight`</b>: Deprecated alias for `weights`.

##### Returns:

  A scalar `Tensor` representing the loss value.

##### Raises:


*  <b>`ValueError`</b>: If the shape of `predictions` doesn't match that of `labels` or
    if the shape of `weight` is invalid.
