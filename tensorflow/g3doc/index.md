# TensorFlow for Googlers

TensorFlowâ„¢ is an open source software library for numerical computation using
data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while
the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow
between them. This flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to
one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device without
rewriting code. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and
engineers working on the Google Brain team within Google's Machine
Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine
learning and deep neural networks research. The system is general enough to be
applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well. The following documents
show you how to set up and use the TensorFlow system.
