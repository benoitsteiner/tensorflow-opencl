  """An `EventMultiplexer` manages access to multiple `EventAccumulator`s.

  Each `EventAccumulator` is associated with a `run`, which is a self-contained
  TensorFlow execution. The `EventMultiplexer` provides methods for extracting
  information about events from multiple `run`s.

  Example usage for loading specific runs from files:

  ```python
  x = EventMultiplexer({'run1': 'path/to/run1', 'run2': 'path/to/run2'})
  x.Reload()
  ```

  Example usage for loading a directory where each subdirectory is a run

  ```python
  (eg:) /parent/directory/path/
        /parent/directory/path/run1/
        /parent/directory/path/run1/events.out.tfevents.1001
        /parent/directory/path/run1/events.out.tfevents.1002

        /parent/directory/path/run2/
        /parent/directory/path/run2/events.out.tfevents.9232

        /parent/directory/path/run3/
        /parent/directory/path/run3/events.out.tfevents.9232
  x = EventMultiplexer().AddRunsFromDirectory('/parent/directory/path')
  (which is equivalent to:)
  x = EventMultiplexer({'run1': '/parent/directory/path/run1', 'run2':...}
  ```

  If you would like to watch `/parent/directory/path`, wait for it to be created
    (if necessary) and then periodically pick up new runs, use
    `AutoloadingMultiplexer`
