# TensorFlow SavedModel

[TOC]

## Overview
This document describes SavedModel, the universal serialization format for
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) models.

SavedModel provides a language-neutral format to save machine-learned models
that is recoverable and hermetic. It enables higher-level systems and tools to
produce, consume and transform TensorFlow models.

## Features

The following is a summary of the features in SavedModel:

* Multiple graphs sharing a single set of variables and assets can be added to a
  single SavedModel. Each graph is associated with a specific set of tags to
  allow identification during a load or restore operation.
* Support for `SignatureDefs`
    * Graphs that are used for inference tasks typically have a set of inputs
      and outputs. This is called a `Signature`.
    * SavedModel uses [SignatureDefs](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/protobuf/meta_graph.proto)
      to allow generic support for signatures that may need to be saved with the graphs.
* Support for `Assets`.
    * For cases where ops depend on external files for initialization, such as
      vocabularies, SavedModel supports this via `assets`.
    * Assets are copied to the SavedModel location and can be read when loading
      a specific meta graph def.
* Support to clear devices before generating the SavedModel.

The following is a summary of features that are NOT supported in SavedModel.
Higher-level frameworks and tools that use SavedModel may provide these.

* Implicit versioning.
* Garbage collection.
* Atomic writes to the SavedModel location.

## Background
SavedModel manages and builds upon existing TensorFlow primitives such as
`TensorFlow Saver` and `MetaGraphDef`. Specifically, SavedModel wraps a [TensorFlow Saver](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/python/training/saver.py).
The Saver is primarily used to generate the variable checkpoints. SavedModel
will replace the existing [TensorFlow Inference Model Format](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/session_bundle/README.md)
as the canonical way to export TensorFlow graphs for serving.

## Components
A SavedModel directory has the following structure:

```
assets/
assets.extra/
variables/
    variables.data-?????-of-?????
    variables.index
saved_model.pb
```

* SavedModel protocol buffer
    * `saved_model.pb` or `saved_model.pbtxt`
    * Includes the graph definitions as `MetaGraphDef` protocol buffers.
* Assets
    * Subfolder called `assets`.
    * Contains auxiliary files such as vocabularies, etc.
* Extra assets
    * Subfolder where higher-level libraries and users can add their own assets
      that co-exist with the model, but are not loaded by the graph.
    * This subfolder is not managed by the SavedModel libraries.
* Variables
    * Subfolder called `variables`.
    * Includes output from the [TensorFlow Saver](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/python/training/saver.py).
        * `variables.data-?????-of-?????`
        * `variables.index`

## APIs
The APIs for building and loading a SavedModel are described in this section.

### Builder
The SavedModel [builder](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/saved_model/builder.py)
is implemented in Python.

The `SavedModelBuilder` class provides functionality to save multiple meta graph
defs, associated variables and assets.

To build a SavedModel, the first meta graph must be saved with variables.
Subsequent meta graphs will simply be saved with their graph definitions. If
assets need to be saved and written or copied to disk, they can be provided
when the meta graph def is added. If multiple meta graph defs are associated
with an asset of the same name, only the first version is retained.

#### Tags
Each meta graph added to the SavedModel must be annotated with user specified
tags. The tags provide a means to identify the specific meta graph to load and
restore, along with the shared set of variables and assets. These tags
typically annotate a MetaGraph with it's functionality (e.g. serving or
training), and possibly hardware specific aspects such as GPU.

A subset of commonly used tags is specified in [Python](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/saved_model/tag_constants.py)
and [C++](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/cc/saved_model/tag_constants.h)
for the purpose of easy and consistent usability.

#### Usage
The typical usage of `builder` is as follows:

~~~python
export_dir = ...
...
builder = saved_model_builder.SavedModelBuilder(export_dir)
with tf.Session(graph=tf.Graph()) as sess:
...
builder.add_meta_graph_and_variables(sess,
                                     [tag_constants.TRAINING],
                                     signature_def_map=foo_signatures,
                                     assets_collection=foo_assets)
...
with tf.Session(graph=tf.Graph()) as sess:
  ...
  builder.add_meta_graph(["bar-tag", "baz-tag"])
...
builder.save()
~~~

### Loader
The SavedModel loader is implemented in C++ and Python.

#### Python
The Python version of the SavedModel [loader](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/saved_model/builder.py)
provides load and restore capability for a SavedModel. The `load` operation
requires the session in which to restore the graph definition and variables, the
tags used to identify the meta graph def to load and the location of the
SavedModel. Upon a load, the subset of variables and assets supplied as part of
the specific meta graph def, will be restored into the supplied session.

~~~python
export_dir = ...
...
with tf.Session(graph=tf.Graph()) as sess:
  loader.load(sess, [tag_constants.TRAINING], export_dir)
  ...
~~~

#### C++
The C++ version of the SavedModel [loader](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/cc/saved_model/loader.h)
provides an API to load a SavedModel from a path, while allowing
`SessionOptions` and `RunOptions`. Similar to the Python version, the C++
version requires the tags associated with the graph to be loaded, to be
specified. The loaded version of SavedModel is referred to as `SavedModelBundle`
and contains the meta graph def and the session within which it is loaded.

~~~c++
const string export_dir = ...
SavedModelBundle bundle;
...
LoadSavedModel(session_options, run_options, export_dir, {kSavedModelTagTrain},
               &bundle);
~~~
