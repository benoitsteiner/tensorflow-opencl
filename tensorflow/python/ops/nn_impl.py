  """Computes log Poisson loss given `log_input`.

  Gives the log-likelihood loss between the prediction and the target under the
  assumption that the target has a Poisson distribution.
  Caveat: By default, this is not the exact loss, but the loss minus a
    constant term [log(z!)]. That has no effect for optimization, but
    does not play well with relative loss comparisons. To compute an
    approximation of the log factorial term, specify
    compute_full_loss=True to enable Stirling's Approximation.

  For brevity, let `c = log(x) = log_input`, `z = targets`.  The log Poisson
  loss is

        -log(exp(-x) * (x^z) / z!)
      = -log(exp(-x) * (x^z)) + log(z!)

  Measures the probability error in discrete classification tasks in which each

  perform multilabel classification where a picture can contain both an elephant

  For brevity, let `x = logits`, `z = targets`.  The logistic loss is

        z * -log(sigmoid(x)) + (1 - z) * -log(1 - sigmoid(x))

  Normalizes a tensor by `mean` and `variance`, and applies (optionally) a
  `scale` \\(\gamma\\) to it, as well as an `offset` \\(\beta\\):

  \\(\frac{\gamma(x-\mu)}{\sigma}+\beta\\)

  `mean`, `variance`, `offset` and `scale` are all expected to be of one of two
  shapes:

    * In all generality, they can have the same number of dimensions as the
      input `x`, with identical sizes as `x` for the dimensions that are not
      normalized over (the 'depth' dimension(s)), and dimension 1 for the
      others which are being normalized over.
      `mean` and `variance` in this case would typically be the outputs of
      `tf.nn.moments(..., keep_dims=True)` during training, or running averages
      thereof during inference.
    * In the common case where the 'depth' dimension is the last dimension in
      the input tensor `x`, they may be one dimensional tensors of the same
      size as the 'depth' dimension.
      This is the case for example for the common `[batch, depth]` layout of
      fully-connected layers, and `[batch, height, width, depth]` for
      convolutions.
      `mean` and `variance` in this case would typically be the outputs of
      `tf.nn.moments(..., keep_dims=False)` during training, or running averages
      thereof during inference.

  Args:
    x: Input `Tensor` of arbitrary dimensionality.
    mean: A mean `Tensor`.
    variance: A variance `Tensor`.
    offset: An offset `Tensor`, often denoted \\(\beta\\) in equations, or
      None. If present, will be added to the normalized tensor.
    scale: A scale `Tensor`, often denoted \\(\gamma\\) in equations, or
      `None`. If present, the scale is applied to the normalized tensor.

  Note: By default this uses a log-uniform (Zipfian) distribution for sampling,
  so your labels must be sorted in order of decreasing frequency to achieve
  good results.  For more details, see
  [log_uniform_candidate_sampler](#log_uniform_candidate_sampler).

  Note: In the case where `num_true` > 1, we assign to each target class
  the target probability 1 / `num_true` so that the target probabilities
  sum to 1 per-example.

  Note: It would be useful to allow a variable number of target classes per
  example.  We hope to provide this functionality in a future release.
  For now, if you have a variable number of target classes, you can pad them
  out to a constant number by either repeating them or by padding
  with an otherwise unused class.

  Args:
    weights: A `Tensor` of shape `[num_classes, dim]`, or a list of `Tensor`
        objects whose concatenation along dimension 0 has shape
        [num_classes, dim].  The (possibly-partitioned) class embeddings.
    biases: A `Tensor` of shape `[num_classes]`.  The class biases.
    inputs: A `Tensor` of shape `[batch_size, dim]`.  The forward
        activations of the input network.
    labels: A `Tensor` of type `int64` and shape `[batch_size,
        num_true]`. The target classes.
    num_sampled: An `int`.  The number of classes to randomly sample per batch.
    num_classes: An `int`. The number of possible classes.
    num_true: An `int`.  The number of target classes per training example.
    sampled_values: a tuple of (`sampled_candidates`, `true_expected_count`,
        `sampled_expected_count`) returned by a `*_candidate_sampler` function.
        (if None, we default to `log_uniform_candidate_sampler`)
    remove_accidental_hits:  A `bool`.  Whether to remove "accidental hits"
        where a sampled class equals one of the target classes.  If set to
        `True`, this is a "Sampled Logistic" loss instead of NCE, and we are
        learning to generate log-odds instead of log probabilities.  See
        our [Candidate Sampling Algorithms Reference]
        (../../extras/candidate_sampling.pdf).
        Default is False.
    partition_strategy: A string specifying the partitioning strategy, relevant
        if `len(weights) > 1`. Currently `"div"` and `"mod"` are supported.
        Default is `"mod"`. See `tf.nn.embedding_lookup` for more details.
    name: A name for the operation (optional).

  Returns:
    A `batch_size` 1-D tensor of per-example NCE losses.

  """Computes and returns the sampled softmax training loss.

  This is a faster way to train a softmax classifier over a huge number of
  classes.

  This operation is for training only.  It is generally an underestimate of
  the full softmax loss.

  At inference time, you can compute full softmax probabilities with the
  expression `tf.nn.softmax(tf.matmul(inputs, tf.transpose(weights)) + biases)`.
