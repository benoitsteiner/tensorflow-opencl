  """Abstract object representing an RNN cell.

  The definition of cell in this package differs from the definition used in the
  literature. In the literature, cell refers to an object with a single scalar
  output. The definition in this package refers to a horizontal array of such
  units.

  An RNN cell, in the most abstract setting, is anything that has
  a state and performs some operation that takes a matrix of inputs.
  This operation results in an output matrix with `self.output_size` columns.
  If `self.state_size` is an integer, this operation also results in a new
  state matrix with `self.state_size` columns.  If `self.state_size` is a
  tuple of integers, then it results in a tuple of `len(state_size)` state
  matrices, each with a column size corresponding to values in `state_size`.

  This module provides a number of basic commonly used RNN cells, such as
  LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) or GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), and a number
  of operators that allow add dropouts, projections, or embeddings for inputs.
  Constructing multi-layer cells is supported by the class `MultiRNNCell`,
  or by calling the `rnn` ops several times. Every `RNNCell` must have the
  properties below and implement `__call__` with the following signature.

      state: if `self.state_size` is an integer, this should be a `2-D Tensor`
        with shape `[batch_size x self.state_size]`.  Otherwise, if
        `self.state_size` is a tuple of integers, this should be a tuple
        with shapes `[batch_size x s] for s in self.state_size`.
