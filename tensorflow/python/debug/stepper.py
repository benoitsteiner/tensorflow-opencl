  """TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg) stepper.

  The stepper provides ability to perform "continue to" actions on a graph,
  given fetch and feeds. The stepper calculates the transitive closure of the
  fetch. cont() (continue to) calls can only be performed on members of the
  transitive closure.

  On a cont() call, the stepper performs depth-first tracing of the input
  tree of the target. When it reaches an input where one of the following is
  available, it will supply the available value to the feed_dict of the cont()
  call:
    (1) TensorHandles from previous cont() calls.
    (2) Overriding (injected) values from the client.
    (3) Feeds supplied during the construction of the stepper instance.

  Once the tracing is complete, it will issue a run() call on the
  underlying session, using the aforementioned feed_dict prepared by the input
  tracing, to achieve the "continue-to" action. The above process takes into
  account whether the transitive closure of an input contains Variables that
  are updated during previous cont() calls on this stepper instance. If such
  updates exist, we say the transitive closure is "dirty" and the stepper
  can restore the "clean" state of the Variable and avoid using the
  TensorHandle.

  Example of basic usage:
    a = tf.Variable(1.0, name="a")
    b = tf.Variable(2.0, anme="b")
    c = tf.add(a, b, name="c")
    d = tf.mul(a, c, name="d")

    sess = tf.Session()
    sess.run(tf.initialize_all_varialbes())
    stepper = NodeStepper(sess, d)
