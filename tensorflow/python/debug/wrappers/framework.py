"""Framework of debug wrapper sessions.

A debug wrapper session is a wrapper around a TensorFlow Python Session.
The wrapper preserves the Session interface, most importantly the run() method,
while providing abilities to:
a) Intercept a run() call to a wrapped session and insert debug tensor watches
   according to externally-specified debug URLs.

b) Release control to an external (i.e., non-Session) object before and after
   the run() call, so that the external object can perform actions such as
   launching a UI to let users inspect the intermediate tensors and partition
   graphs from the run() call.

c) (To be implemented) Intercept a run() call and give control to DebugStepper
   to let it perform stepping / continuing-to actions on the graph.

b) (To be implemented in a future CL) Enter an instruction loop to let an
   external object (e.g., remote client) launch run() and cont() calls
   remotely.

*** The lifetime of a debug wrapper session: ***

1) The wrapper session is created by calling the constructor with a
   wrapped (normal) session as the argument:
     wrapper = FooDebugWrapperSession(sess)
   wherein FooDebugWrapperSession is a concrete subclass implementing the
   abstract BaseDebugWrapperSession class below.

2) Near the end of the constructor call, the on_session_init() callback is
   invoked, with a OnSessionInitRequest object as the argument. The object
   carries the wrapped (normal) session object.

3) The callback handles the request and returns a OnSessionInitResponse
   object with an action field, directing the wrapper session what to do next.

If the action field in the OnSessionInitResponse is PROCEED, the constuctor
returns. Control is released back to the caller of the constructor, which can
invoke run() method of wrapper session with the same syntax as a non-wrapped
session, e.g.,:
  wrapper.run(fetches, feed_dict=feeds, options=run_options)

Below, A1 - A2 is the lifetime of a wrapper run() call if the action is
PROCEED:

A1) Right at the start of each run() call, the on_run_start() callback is
    invoked, with an OnRunStartRequest object carrying information such as
    the fetches, the feed dict, the run options and run metadata used in
    this run call, along with a count of how many run calls has occurred
    on this wrapper session. The callback then returns an OnRunStartResponse
    object, of which the action field directs what the wrapper session
    actually will do of the run() call.

    If the action is DEBUG_RUN, a debugged (tensor-watched) run will ensue,
    with the debug URLs supplied in the debug_urls field of the response.
    These can be file:// or grpc:// URLs, for example.

    If the action is NON_DEBUG_RUN, a non-debug (normal) run will ensue.

    If the action is INVOKE_STEPPER, no run() call will be issued to the
    wrapped session. But instead, a DebugStepper (i.e., "continuation
    debugger") will be used to perform stepping / continue-to actions on
    the graph.

TODO(cais): The event loop for the DebugStepper will request additional
   callbacks including on_cont_start() and on_cont_end(). Add those.

A2) Right before the run() returns, the on_run_end() callback is invoked,
    with an OnRunEndRequest object as the argument, which carries information
    including the actual action performed in the warpper run() call and the
    run_metadata from the run() call.

However, if the action field in OnSessionInitResponse is
REMOTE_INSTR_LOOP, the constructor will automatically invoke an instruction loop
that gives the control to a remote caller.

In the remote instruction loop, the following steps will happen:

B1) Callback on_instr_start() is invoked. The callback will return an
    OnInstrStartResponse object with an action field which can order one of
    the following actions:
        i) a run() call with fetches, feeds and debug_urls specified.
       ii) a DebugStepper cont() call with target specified.
      iii) value overrides in the cached tensors from the DebugStepper.
       iv) exit the instruction loop.

B2) The wrapper session carries out the action specified above.

B3) If still in the instruction loop, the wrapper session invokes the
    on_instr_end() callback. After the on_instr_end() callback returns, jump
    back to B1.

TODO(cais): Implemented the instruction loop in B1 - B3.
