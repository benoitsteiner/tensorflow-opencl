  """Densely-connected layer class.

  This layer implements the operation:
  `outputs = activation(inputs.kernel + bias)`
  Where `activation` is the activation function passed as the `activation`
  argument (if not `None`), `kernel` is a weights matrix created by the layer,
  and `bias` is a bias vector created by the layer
  (only if `use_bias` is `True`).

  Note: if the input to the layer has a rank greater than 2, then it is
  flattened prior to the initial matrix multiply by `w`.

  Arguments:
    units: Integer or Long, dimensionality of the output space.
    activation: Activation function (callable). Set it to None to maintain a
      linear activation.
    use_bias: Boolean, whether the layer uses a bias.
    kernel_initializer: Initializer function for the weight matrix.
    bias_initializer: Initializer function for the bias.
    kernel_regularizer: Regularizer function for the weight matrix.
    bias_regularizer: Regularizer function for the bias.
    activity_regularizer: Regularizer function for the output.
    trainable: Boolean, if `True` also add variables to the graph collection
      `GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES` (see tf.Variable).
    name: String, the name of the layer. Layers with the same name will
      share weights, but to avoid mistakes we require reuse=True in such cases.
    reuse: Boolean, whether to reuse the weights of a previous layer
      by the same name.

  Properties:
    units: Python integer, dimensionality of the output space.
    activation: Activation function (callable).
    use_bias: Boolean, whether the layer uses a bias.
    kernel_initializer: Initializer instance (or name) for the weight matrix.
    bias_initializer: Initializer instance (or name) for the bias.
    kernel_regularizer: Regularizer instance for the weight matrix (callable)
    bias_regularizer: Regularizer instance for the bias (callable).
    activity_regularizer: Regularizer instance for the output (callable)
    kernel: Weight matrix (TensorFlow variable or tensor).
