  """Return a `device function` to use when building a Graph for replicas.

  Device Functions are used in `with tf.device(device_function):` statement to
  automatically assign devices to `Operation` objects as they are constructed,
  Device constraints are added from the inner-most context first, working
  outwards. The merging behavior adds constraints to fields that are yet unset
  by a more inner context. Currently the fields are (job, task, cpu/gpu).

  If `cluster` is `None`, and `ps_tasks` is 0, the returned function is a no-op.
  Otherwise, the value of `ps_tasks` is derived from `cluster`.

  By default, only Variable ops are placed on ps tasks, and the placement
  strategy is round-robin over all ps tasks. A custom `ps_strategy` may be used
  to do more intelligent placement, such as
  `tf.contrib.training.GreedyLoadBalancingStrategy`.

  For example,

  ```python
  # To build a cluster with two ps jobs on hosts ps0 and ps1, and 3 worker
  # jobs on hosts worker0, worker1 and worker2.
  cluster_spec = {
      "ps": ["ps0:2222", "ps1:2222"],
      "worker": ["worker0:2222", "worker1:2222", "worker2:2222"]}
  with tf.device(tf.train.replica_device_setter(cluster=cluster_spec)):
    # Build your graph
    v1 = tf.Variable(...)  # assigned to /job:ps/task:0
    v2 = tf.Variable(...)  # assigned to /job:ps/task:1
    v3 = tf.Variable(...)  # assigned to /job:ps/task:0
  # Run compute
  ```

  Args:
    ps_tasks: Number of tasks in the `ps` job.  Ignored if `cluster` is
      provided.
    ps_device: String.  Device of the `ps` job.  If empty no `ps` job is used.
      Defaults to `ps`.
    worker_device: String.  Device of the `worker` job.  If empty no `worker`
      job is used.
    merge_devices: `Boolean`. If `True`, merges or only sets a device if the
      device constraint is completely unset. merges device specification rather
      than overriding them.
    cluster: `ClusterDef` proto or `ClusterSpec`.
    ps_ops: List of strings representing `Operation` types that need to be
      placed on `ps` devices.  If `None`, defaults to `["Variable"]`.
    ps_strategy: A callable invoked for every ps `Operation` (i.e. matched by
      `ps_ops`), that takes the `Operation` and returns the ps task index to
      use.  If `None`, defaults to a round-robin strategy across all `ps`
      devices.

  Returns:
    A function to pass to `tf.device()`.

  Raises:
    TypeError if `cluster` is not a dictionary or `ClusterDef` protocol buffer,
    or if `ps_strategy` is provided but not a callable.
