# Please note that the gradients from replicas are averaged instead of summed

# rate according to the number of replicas. This change is introduced to be
# consistent with how gradients are aggregated (averaged) within a batch in a
# replica.
class SyncReplicasOptimizerV2(optimizer.Optimizer):
  """Class to synchronize, aggregate gradients and pass them to the optimizer.

  In a typical asynchronous training environment, it's common to have some
  stale gradients. For example, with a N-replica asynchronous training,
  gradients will be applied to the variables N times independently. Depending
  on each replica's training speed, some gradients might be calculated from
  copies of the variable from several steps back (N-1 steps on average). This
  optimizer avoids stale gradients by collecting gradients from all replicas,
  averaging them, then applying them to the variables in one shot, after
  which replicas can fetch the new variables and continue.

  The following accumulators/queue are created:
  <empty line>
  * N `gradient accumulators`, one per variable to train. Gradients are pushed
    to them and the chief worker will wait until enough gradients are collected
    and then average them before applying to variables. The accumulator will
    drop all stale gradients (more details in the accumulator op).
  * 1 `token` queue where the optimizer pushes the new global_step value after
    all variables are updated.

  The following local variable is created:
  * `sync_rep_local_step`, one per replica. Compared against the global_step in
    each accumulator to check for staleness of the gradients.

  The optimizer adds nodes to the graph to collect gradients and pause the
  trainers until variables are updated.
  For the Parameter Server job:
  <empty line>
  1. An accumulator is created for each variable, and each replica pushes the
     gradients into the accumulators instead of directly applying them to the
     variables.
  2. Each accumulator averages once enough gradients (replicas_to_aggregate)
     have been accumulated.
  3. Apply the averaged gradients to the variables.
  4. Only after all variables have been updated, increment the global step.
  5. Only after step 4, pushes `global_step` in the `token_queue`, once for
     each worker replica. The workers can now fetch the global step, use it to
     update its local_step variable and start the next batch.

  For the replicas:
  <empty line>
  1. Start a step: fetch variables and compute gradients.
  2. Once the gradients have been computed, push them into gradient
     accumulators. Each accumulator will check the staleness and drop the stale.
  3. After pushing all the gradients, dequeue an updated value of global_step
     from the token queue and record that step to its local_step variable. Note
     that this is effectively a barrier.
  4. Start the next batch.

  ### Usage

  # Create any optimizer to update the variables, say a simple SGD:
  opt = GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate=0.1)

  # Wrap the optimizer with sync_replicas_optimizer with 50 replicas: at each
  # step the optimizer collects 50 gradients before applying to variables.
  # Note that if you want to have 2 backup replicas, you can change
  # total_num_replicas=52 and make sure this number matches how many physical
  # replicas you started in your job.
  opt = tf.SyncReplicasOptimizerV2(opt, replicas_to_aggregate=50,
                                   total_num_replicas=50)

  # Some models have startup_delays to help stabilize the model but when using
  # sync_replicas training, set it to 0.

  # Now you can call `minimize()` or `compute_gradients()` and
  # `apply_gradients()` normally
  grads = opt.minimize(total_loss, global_step=self.global_step)


  # You can now call get_init_tokens_op() and get_chief_queue_runner().
  # Note that get_init_tokens_op() must be called before creating session
  # because it modifies the graph by adding new nodes.
  init_token_op = opt.get_init_tokens_op()
  chief_queue_runner = opt.get_chief_queue_runner()
  ```

  In the training program, every worker will run the train_op as if not
  synchronized. But one worker (usually the chief) will need to execute the
  chief_queue_runner and get_init_tokens_op from this optimizer.

  ```python
  # When you create the supervisor, you need to add the local_init_op and
  # ready_for_local_init_op to make sure the local_step is initialized to the
  # global_step. Here is an example:
  if is_chief:
    local_init_op = opt.chief_init_op
  else:
    local_init_op = opt.local_step_init_op
  ready_for_local_init_op = opt.ready_for_local_init_op
