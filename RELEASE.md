# Changes since the last release

## Breaking Changes to the API

* Division and modulus operators (/, //, %) now match Python (flooring)
  semantics. This applies to `tf.div` and `tf.mod` as well. To obtain forced
  integer truncation based behaviors you can use `tf.truncatediv`
  and `tf.truncatemod`.
* `tf.divide()` is now the recommended division function. `tf.div()` will
  remain, but its semantics do not respond to Python 3 or `from future`
  mechanisms.
* tf.reverse() now takes indices of axes to be reversed. E.g.
  `tf.reverse(a, [True, False, True])` must now be written as
  `tf.reverse(a, [0, 2])`. `tf.reverse_v2()` will remain until 1.0 final.
* `tf.mul`, `tf.sub` and `tf.neg` are deprecated in favor of `tf.multiply`,
  `tf.subtract` and `tf.negative`.
* `tf.pack` and `tf.unpack` are deprecated in favor of `tf.stack` and
  `tf.unstack`.
* `TensorArray.pack` and `TensorArray.unpack` are getting deprecated in favor of
  `TensorArray.stack` and `TensorArray.unstack`.
* The following Python functions have had their arguments changed to use `axis`
  when referring to specific dimensions. We have kept the old keyword arguments
  for compatibility currently, but we will be removing them well before the
  final 1.0.
  * `tf.argmax`: `dimension` becomes `axis`
  * `tf.argmin`: `dimension` becomes `axis`
  * `tf.count_nonzero`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`
  * `tf.expand_dims`: `dim` becomes `axis`
  * `tf.reduce_all`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`
  * `tf.reduce_any`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`
  * `tf.reduce_join`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`
  * `tf.reduce_logsumexp`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`
  * `tf.reduce_max`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`
  * `tf.reduce_mean`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`
  * `tf.reduce_min`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`
  * `tf.reduce_prod`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`
  * `tf.reduce_sum`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`
  * `tf.reverse_sequence`: `batch_dim` becomes `batch_axis`, `seq_dim` becomes `seq_axis`
  * `tf.sparse_concat`: `concat_dim` becomes `axis`
  * `tf.sparse_reduce_sum`: `reduction_axes` becomes `axis`
  * `tf.sparse_reduce_sum_sparse`: `reduction_axes` becomes `axis`
  * `tf.sparse_split`: `split_dim` becomes `axis`
* `tf.listdiff` has been renamed to `tf.setdiff1d` to match NumPy naming.
* `tf.inv` has been renamed to be `tf.reciprocal` (component-wise reciprocal)
  to avoid confusion with `np.inv` which is matrix inversion
* tf.round now uses banker's rounding (round to even) semantics to match NumPy.
* `tf.split` now takes arguments in a reversed order and with different
  keywords. In particular, we now match NumPy order as
  `tf.split(value, num_or_size_splits, axis)`.
* `tf.sparse_split` now takes arguments in reversed order and with different
  keywords. In particular we now match NumPy order as
  `tf.sparse_split(sp_input, num_split, axis)`. NOTE: we have temporarily
  made `tf.sparse_split` require keyword arguments.
* Deprecated `tf.concat` operator. Please switch to use `tf.concat_v2` for now.
  In the Beta release, we will update `tf.concat` to match argument order of
  `tf.concat_v2.
* tf.image.decode_jpeg by default uses the faster DCT method, sacrificing
  a little fidelity for improved speed. One can revert to the old
  behavior by specifying the attribute dct_method='INTEGER_ACCURATE'.

# Release 0.12.0

## Major Features and Improvements

* TensorFlow now builds and runs on Microsoft Windows (tested on Windows 10,
  Windows 7, and Windows Server 2016). Supported languages include Python (via a
  pip package) and C++. CUDA 8.0 and cuDNN 5.1 are supported for GPU
  acceleration. Known limitations include: It is not currently possible to load
  a custom op library. The GCS and HDFS file systems are not currently
  supported. The following ops are not currently implemented:
  Dequantize, QuantizeAndDequantize, QuantizedAvgPool,
  QuantizedBatchNomWithGlobalNormalization, QuantizedBiasAdd, QuantizedConcat,
  QuantizedConv2D, QuantizedMatmul, QuantizedMaxPool,
  QuantizeDownAndShrinkRange, QuantizedRelu, QuantizedRelu6, QuantizedReshape,
  QuantizeV2, RequantizationRange, and Requantize.
* Go: Experimental API in Go to create and execute graphs
  (https://godoc.org/github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go)
* New checkpoint format becomes the default in `tf.train.Saver`. Old V1
  checkpoints continue to be readable; controlled by the `write_version`
  argument, `tf.train.Saver` now by default writes out in the new V2
  format. It significantly reduces the peak memory required and latency
  incurred during restore.
* Added a new library for library of matrix-free (iterative) solvers for linear
  equations, linear least-squares, eigenvalues and singular values in
  tensorflow/contrib/solvers. Initial version has lanczos bidiagonalization,
  conjugate gradients and CGLS.
* Added gradients for `matrix_solve_ls` and `self_adjoint_eig`.
* Large cleanup to add second order gradient for ops with C++ gradients and
  improve existing gradients such that most ops can now be differentiated
  multiple times.
* Added a solver for ordinary differential equations,
  `tf.contrib.integrate.odeint`.
* New contrib module for tensors with named axes, `tf.contrib.labeled_tensor`.
* Visualization of embeddings in TensorBoard.

## Breaking Changes to the API

* `BusAdjacency` enum replaced with a protocol buffer `DeviceLocality`.  PCI bus
  indexing now starts from 1 instead of 0, and bus_id==0 is used where
  previously BUS_ANY was used.
* `Env::FileExists` and `FileSystem::FileExists` now return a tensorflow::Status
  intead of a bool. Any callers to this function can be converted to a bool
  by adding .ok() to the call.
* The C API type `TF_SessionWithGraph` has been renamed to `TF_Session`,
  indicating its preferred use in language bindings for TensorFlow.
  What was previously `TF_Session` has been renamed to `TF_DeprecatedSession`.
* Renamed TF_Port to TF_Output in the C API.
* Removes RegisterShape from public API. Use C++ shape function registration instead.
  indexing now starts from 1 instead of 0, and `bus_id==0` is used where
  previously `BUS_ANY` was used.
* Most RNN cells and RNN functions now use different variable scopes to be
  consistent with layers (`tf.contrib.layers`).  This means old checkpoints
  written using this code will not load after this change without providing
  `Saver` a list of variable renames.  Examples of variable scope changes
  include `RNN` -> `rnn` in `tf.nn.rnn`, `tf.nn.dynamic_rnn` and moving from
  `Linear/Matrix` -> `weights` and `Linear/Bias` -> `biases` in most RNN cells.
* Deprecated tf.select op. tf.where should be used instead.
* `SparseTensor.shape` has been renamed to `SparseTensor.dense_shape`.  Same for
  `SparseTensorValue.shape`.
* `Env::FileExists` and `FileSystem::FileExists` now return a
  `tensorflow::Status` intead of a bool. Any callers to this function can be
  converted to a bool by adding `.ok()` to the call.
* C API: Type `TF_SessionWithGraph` has been renamed to `TF_Session`, indicating
  its preferred use in language bindings for TensorFlow. What was previously
  `TF_Session` has been renamed to `TF_DeprecatedSession`.
* C API: Renamed `TF_Port` to `TF_Output`.
* C API: The caller retains ownership of `TF_Tensor` objects provided to
  `TF_Run`, `TF_SessionRun`, `TF_SetAttrTensor` etc.
* Renamed `tf.image.per_image_whitening()` to
  `tf.image.per_image_standardization()`
* Move Summary protobuf constructors to `tf.summary` submodule.
* Deprecate `histogram_summary`, `audio_summary`, `scalar_summary`,
  `image_summary`, `merge_summary`, and `merge_all_summaries`.
* Combined `batch_*` and regular version of linear algebra and FFT ops. The
  regular op now handles batches as well. All `batch_*` Python interfaces were
  removed.
* `tf.all_variables`, `tf.VARIABLES` and `tf.initialize_all_variables` renamed
  to `tf.global_variables`, `tf.GLOBAL_VARIABLES` and
  `tf.global_variables_initializer` respectively.

## Bug Fixes and Other Changes

* Use threadsafe version of `lgamma` function.
* Fix `tf.sqrt` handling of negative arguments.
* Fixed bug causing incorrect number of threads to be used for multi-threaded
  benchmarks.
* Performance optimizations for `batch_matmul` on multi-core CPUs.
* Improve trace, `matrix_set_diag`, `matrix_diag_part` and their gradients to
  work for rectangular matrices.
* Support for SVD of complex valued matrices.

# Release 0.11.0

## Major Features and Improvements

* CUDA 8 support.
* cuDNN 5 support.
* HDFS Support.
* Adds Fused LSTM support via cuDNN 5 in `tensorflow/contrib/cudnn_rnn`.
* Improved support for NumPy style basic slicing including non-1 strides,
  ellipses, newaxis, and negative indices. For example complicated expressions
  like `foo[1, 2:4, tf.newaxis, ..., :-3:-1, :]` are now supported. In addition
  we have preliminary (non-broadcasting) support for sliced assignment to
  variables. In particular one can write `var[1:3].assign([1,11,111])`.
* Deprecated `tf.op_scope` and `tf.variable_op_scope` in favor of a unified `tf.name_scope` and `tf.variable_scope`. The new argument order of `tf.variable_scope` is incompatible with previous versions.
* Introducing `core/util/tensor_bundle` module: a module to efficiently
  serialize/deserialize tensors to disk.  Will be used in TF's new checkpoint
  format.
* Added tf.svd for computing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of dense
  matrices or batches of matrices (CPU only).
* Added gradients for eigenvalues and eigenvectors computed using
  `self_adjoint_eig` or `self_adjoint_eigvals`.
* Eliminated `batch_*` methods for most linear algebra and FFT ops and promoted
  the non-batch version of the ops to handle batches of matrices.
* Tracing/timeline support for distributed runtime (no GPU profiler yet).
* C API gives access to inferred shapes with `TF_GraphGetTensorNumDims` and
  `TF_GraphGetTensorShape`.
* Shape functions for core ops have moved to C++ via
  `REGISTER_OP(...).SetShapeFn(...)`.  Python shape inference RegisterShape calls
  use the C++ shape functions with `common_shapes.call_cpp_shape_fn`.  A future
  release will remove `RegisterShape` from python.


## Bug Fixes and Other Changes

* Documentation now includes operator overloads on Tensor and Variable.
* `tensorflow.__git_version__` now allows users to identify the version of the
  code that TensorFlow was compiled with. We also have
  `tensorflow.__git_compiler__` which identifies the compiler used to compile
  TensorFlow's core.
* Improved multi-threaded performance of `batch_matmul`.
* LSTMCell, BasicLSTMCell, and MultiRNNCell constructors now default to
  `state_is_tuple=True`.  For a quick fix while transitioning to the new
  default, simply pass the argument `state_is_tuple=False`.
* DeviceFactory's AddDevices and CreateDevices functions now return
  a Status instead of void.
* Int32 elements of list(type) arguments are no longer placed in host memory by
  default. If necessary, a list(type) argument to a kernel can be placed in host
  memory using a HostMemory annotation.
* `uniform_unit_scaling_initializer()` no longer takes a `full_shape` arg,
  instead relying on the partition info passed to the initializer function when
  it's called.
* The NodeDef protocol message is now defined in its own file `node_def.proto`
  `instead of graph.proto`.
* `ops.NoGradient` was renamed `ops.NotDifferentiable`. `ops.NoGradient` will
  be removed soon.
* `dot.h` / DotGraph was removed (it was an early analysis tool prior
  to TensorBoard, no longer that useful).  It remains in history
  should someone find the code useful.
* re2 / regexp.h was removed from being a public interface of TF.
  Should users need regular expressions, they should depend on the RE2
  library directly rather than via TensorFlow.

# Release 0.7.1

## Bug Fixes and Other Changes

* Added gfile.Open and gfile.Copy, used by input_data.py.
* Fixed Saver bug when MakeDirs tried to create empty directory.
* GPU Pip wheels are built with cuda 7.5 and cudnn-v4, making them
  required for the binary releases. Lower versions of cuda/cudnn can
  be supported by installing from sources and setting the options
  during ./configure
* Fix dataset encoding example for Python3 (@danijar)
* Fix PIP installation by not packaging protobuf as part of wheel,
  require protobuf 3.0.0b2.
* Fix Mac pip installation of numpy by requiring pip >= 1.10.1.
* Improvements and fixes to Docker image.


# Release 0.7.0

## Major Features and Improvements

* Allow using any installed Cuda >= 7.0 and cuDNN >= R2, and add support
  for cuDNN R4
* Added a `contrib/` directory for unsupported or experimental features,
  including higher level `layers` module
* Added an easy way to add and dynamically load user-defined ops
* Built out a good suite of tests, things should break less!
* Added `MetaGraphDef` which makes it easier to save graphs with metadata
* Added assignments for "Deep Learning with TensorFlow" udacity course


## Bug Fixes and Other Changes

* Added a versioning framework for `GraphDef`s to ensure compatibility
* Enforced Python 3 compatibility
* Internal changes now show up as sensibly separated commits
* Open-sourced the doc generator
* Un-fork Eigen
* Simplified the `BUILD` files and cleaned up C++ headers
* TensorFlow can now be used as a submodule in another bazel build
* New ops (e.g., `*fft`, `*_matrix_solve`)
* Support for more data types in many ops
* Performance improvements
* Various bugfixes
* Documentation fixes and improvements


## Breaking Changes to the API

* `AdjustContrast` kernel deprecated, new kernel `AdjustContrastv2` takes and
  outputs float only. `adjust_contrast` now takes all data types.
* `adjust_brightness`'s `delta` argument is now always assumed to be in `[0,1]`
  (as is the norm for images in floating point formats), independent of the
  data type of the input image.
* The image processing ops do not take `min` and `max` inputs any more, casting
  safety is handled by `saturate_cast`, which makes sure over- and underflows
  are handled before casting to data types with smaller ranges.
* For C++ API users: `IsLegacyScalar` and `IsLegacyVector` are now gone from
  `TensorShapeUtils` since TensorFlow is scalar strict within Google (for
  example, the shape argument to `tf.reshape` can't be a scalar anymore).  The
  open source release was already scalar strict, so outside Google `IsScalar`
  and `IsVector` are exact replacements.
* The following files are being removed from `tensorflow/core/public/`:
    * `env.h` -> `../platform/env.h`
    * `status.h` -> `../lib/core/status.h`
    * `tensor.h` -> `../framework/tensor.h`
    * `tensor_shape.h` -> `../framework/tensor_shape.h`
    * `partial_tensor_shape.h` -> `../framework/partial_tensor_shape.h`
    * `tensorflow_server.h` deleted
* For C++ API users: `TensorShape::ShortDebugString` has been renamed to
  `DebugString`, and the previous `DebugString` behavior is gone (it was
  needlessly verbose and produced a confusing empty string for scalars).
* `GraphOptions.skip_common_subexpression_elimination` has been removed. All
  graph optimizer options are now specified via
  `GraphOptions.OptimizerOptions`.
* `ASSERT_OK` / `EXPECT_OK` macros conflicted with external projects, so they
  were renamed `TF_ASSERT_OK`, `TF_EXPECT_OK`.  The existing macros are
  currently maintained for short-term compatibility but will be removed.
* The non-public `nn.rnn` and the various `nn.seq2seq` methods now return
  just the final state instead of the list of all states.
* `tf.scatter_update` now no longer guarantees that lexicographically largest
  index be used for update when duplicate entries exist.
* `tf.image.random_crop(image, [height, width])` is now
  `tf.random_crop(image, [height, width, depth])`, and `tf.random_crop` works
  for any rank (not just 3-D images).  The C++ `RandomCrop` op has been replaced
  with pure Python.
* Renamed `tf.test.GetTempDir` and `tf.test.IsBuiltWithCuda` to
  `tf.test.get_temp_dir` and `tf.test.is_built_with_cuda` for PEP-8
  compatibility.
* `parse_example`'s interface has changed, the old interface is accessible in
  `legacy_parse_example` (same for related functions).
* New `Variable`s are not added to the same collection several times even if
  a list with duplicates is passed to the constructor.
* The Python API will now properly set the `list` member of `AttrValue` in
  constructed `GraphDef` messages for empty lists.  The serialization of some
  graphs will change, but the change is both forwards and backwards compatible.
  It will break tests that compare a generated `GraphDef` to a golden serialized

# Release 0.6.0

## Major Features and Improvements

* Python 3.3+ support via changes to python codebase and ability
  to specify python version via ./configure.

* Some improvements to GPU performance and memory usage:
  [convnet benchmarks](https://github.com/soumith/convnet-benchmarks/issues/66)
  roughly equivalent with native cudnn v2 performance.  Improvements mostly due
  to moving to 32-bit indices, faster shuffling kernels.  More improvements to
  come in later releases.


## Bug Fixes

* Lots of fixes to documentation and tutorials, many contributed
  by the public.

* 271 closed issues on github issues.

## Backwards-Incompatible Changes

* `tf.nn.fixed_unigram_candidate_sampler` changed its default 'distortion'
  attribute from 0.0 to 1.0. This was a bug in the original release
  that is now fixed.

# Release 0.5.0

Initial release of TensorFlow.
